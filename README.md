Online Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment Analysis (SA) relates to the use of: Natural Language Processing (NLP), analysis and computational linguistics text to extract and identify subjective information in the source material. 
A fundamental task of SA is to "classify" the polarity of a given document text, phrases or levels of functionality/appearance - whether the opinion expressed in a document or in a sentence is positive, negative or neutral.
Usually, this analysis is performed "offline" using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. In this project two online tweet classification methods have been proposed, which exploits the well known framework "Apache Spark" for processing the data and the tool "Apache Zeppelin" for data visualization.
